The company has managed to get more than 8, 00, 000 Swiggy mobile application downloads and has become a default name for everyone and anyone who desires to order food online.

The online food delivery chain has been known to hire local boys for deliveries which create a lot of employment for people in these 13 cities of India. The story looks impressive but was it easy for Swiggy to reach such level of success? Well, founders say that success is not achieved over one night of hard work.

# Swiggy Restaurants Data for Predictive Analytics

Data Requirement completely depend on our problem.

• In this project, to perform analysis, we are using datasets that are
provided by iNeuronIntelligence Pvt. Ltd.

# Business Case Study Questions

1. To provide an overview of the entire system.
2. To provide introduction of Problem Perspective & Statement, Data Requirements,
Tools used and many more.
3. To provide a module-wise breakup of the entire system


# EDA and Data visualization using Power BI
With the present dataset, interesting insights pertaining to location, restaurant type, and rating can be generated. Power BI is an easy tool and is quite helpful in EDA’s. We will be using the same to answer some basic questions.

 Approach (Architecture):

## Cards Visuals 
A single number, such as total Outlets, types of cusines and average ratings, is sometimes the most important thing you want to track. A type of visualization in Power BI called a card may be the best way to view that number. As with almost all of the native Power BI visualizations, cards can be created using the report editor or Q&A.

 # Summary/Recommendations
In this analysis project, we have been analyzed several different use cases for the given dataset o make better
business decisions and help analyze customer trends and satisfaction, which can lead to new and better
products and services. It has been found that –
• In BTM Area: Most of the Restaurants has 4.0 to 4.2 Rating and Approx. Cost for Two People lies between
200 to 350. (Max. Cost goes up to 600)

• HSR: Most has 4 or above Rating and Approx. Cost for Two People lies between 300 to 400. (Max. Cost goes
up to 800)

• Koramangala: Most has 4.0 to 4.3 Rating and Approx. Cost for Two People lies between 200 to 350. (Max.
Cost goes up to 600) With this we can conclude the Most Costly Area is HSR. We have also analyzed that, we
have Total "82" which are the "Budget Restaurants" as well as they are "Affordable". On top of that, we have
found-out, Most of the Affordable/Budgeted Restaurants are having Excellent Rating as well. Like, For Approx.
Cost of "200", "150", "250", and "450", the Ratings were "4.8", "4.6", and "4.5" respectively. This might be
because Most of the people prefer Affordable/Budget-Restaurants which also provides good quality of
Cuisines. And On the other hand, there are few Expensive Restaurants who doesn't have that much Rating and
they are Expensive too. Those Restaurants Costs around "600" to "800" for Two People are having the Ratings
in between '4.0' to '4.1' which is too less as compared to Affordable/Budgeted Restaurants. In addition to that,
we have also performed Analysis on the Cuisines w.r.t. different Areas/Location and We have found-out:
• In BTM Area, Most of the Restaurants sell "Chinese" which is around '17.1%' followed by "North Indian" &
"South Indian" Cuisines which are around '15.2%' & '9.52%'.

• So, we can also infer that Most of the people are fond of these Cuisines.

• In HSR Area, "North Indian" Cuisines are dominated by around '14.3%' followed by "Chinese" & "South
Indian" Cuisines '9.52%' & '9.52%' Restaurants respectively.

• In Koramangala Area, "Chinese" Cuisines are dominated by around '10.3%' followed by "North Indian" &
"South Indian" Cuisines '9.66%' & '7.59%' Restaurants respectively.

• Furthermore, we have also been analyzed Cheapest/Expensive & Highest Rated Restaurants with Approx.
Cost for 2 People and many more.

 # EndNotes
 
 Data science has a direct impact on unit economics and in Swiggy case, it’s more true than ever. The not-so-hyped aspects of data science are the ones that drive business growth and provide stability. This article tries to connect the dots between them and provide an initial framework for budding analysts.
